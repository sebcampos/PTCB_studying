## Garbing
Garbing is the process of putting on the proper clothing in a specific order in the `garb area `
Garbing process:
- remove all jewelry
- put on personal protective equipment
- perform hand hygiene
- put on gown fastened securley at the neck and wrists
- sanitize hands using an antibacterial hand gel and allow hands to dry
- put on gloves, in some instances two pairs of gloves
- enter the clean room
- sanitize the gloves with application of 70 % sterile isopropyl alcohol and allow gloves to dry

## Laminar Airflow Device
Cleaning the laminar Airflow device process:
- soak a stack of gauze pads with 70 % isopropyl
- clean each side of the laminar flow workstation in the direction of the air (back to front), side to side
- use a new wet stack of gauze pads for each side and the bottom

## Cleaning Supplies
Collecting, setting up, and sterilizing supplies
- remove dust coverings before placing supplies in compounding area
- assemble all supplies directly in the compounding area to minimize air exposure
- work at least 3 inches from the backod the laminar airflow workstation and 6 inches from the front
- swab surfaces with a clean alcohol swab (new swab for every surface) in the direction of airflow

# Human Anatomy and Physiology
- human anatomy is defined as the scientific study of the human bodys structures or parts
- human pysiology is the scientific study of how chemistry and physics work to gether to support and maintain life of anatomical structures in the body

## Gastroinstestinal
### Anatomy

The major anatomic components of the gastroinintestinal tract begin with the oral cavity (mouth), esophagus, stomach, small intestine (duodenum, ileum, jejunum), colon, and ends with the anus.

### Function
The mouth is the entry point for liquid and solid nutrient and begins digestion

### Common conditions
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease
    - movement (reflux) of contents from the stomach into the esophagus, resulting in symptoms such as heartburn (irritation and tissue damage to the esophagus). Also called GERD. Antacids such as Tums or Rolaids as well as H2 blockers reduce or help treat this disease

- Peptic ulcer disease
    - Ulcers or erosions in the lining of the stomach and/or small instestine (duodenum) most commonly caused by a bacterial infection and or use of NSAIDS

- Constipation 
    - Decreased frequency of stool elimination. Medications for sonctipation are also available over the counter. Laxatives or stool softeners such as docusates, bisacodyl, and senna saline, or polyethylene glyco (PEG), electrolyte lavage solution

- Diarrhea
    - Increased frequency of stool elimination; commonly involves loose and/or watery stools. The Pharmacist can recommend a specific product based on patient needs such as Loperamide

## Vasculature
### Anatomy and Function
Arteries carry oxegenated blood from the lungs to the rest of the bodys organs and tissues.
Viens carry deoxegenated blood back to the lungs so that it can be oxegenated through the lungs

### Common conditions
- Hyperlipidemia/Atherosclerosis
    - Chronic elevation of cholesterol, primarily low-density lipoprotien (LDL), in the blood is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease including ishemic heart disease and myocardinal infarction. Patients with high cholesterol are commonly prescribed medications to reduce cholesterol and cardiac risk factors some of the most common medications are listed below:
        - Zocor (simvastatin)
        - Pravachol (pravastatin)
        - Crestor (Rosuvastatin)
        - Lipitor (Atorvastatin)

## Stroke 
There are two categories of stroke:
- ishemic
- hemorrhagic 

The most common is the `ischemic stroke` which typically results from a blood clot obstructing blood flow to a portion of the brain. Signs and symptoms of an ischemic stroke can vary significantly depending on which portion of the brain us affected.

Common symptoms related to muscle weakness/paralysis are included in the acronym FAST

- _F_ acial droopiness/numbness on one side
- _A_  arm weakness/paralysis or numbness on one side
- _S_  peech difficulties
- _T_  ime to call emergency

Symptoms that resolve quickly (usually within minutes) without intervention do not result in permanent neurologic damage. These are called `transient ischemic attacks` or _TIA_ 's and is considered a risk factor for impending ischemic stroke which is associated with prolonged/permanent neurologic damage.

`Hemorrhagic Strokes` are related to bleeding within the brain. While Blood flow may be impeded by the bleed itself, neurologic damage can also occur due to the formation of a hematoma (collection of blood) which increases the pressure on the brain.

common drugs to treat a stroke are plavix (clopidogrel) or coumadin (warafin) or aspirin

## Cardiac
### Anatomy and Function
The heart muscle receives deoxegenated blood from the bodys tissues and pumps the blood to the lungs to become oxegenated. Blood from the lungs is returned to the heart so that the oxygenated blood can be pumped to the rest of the body (commonly called cardiac output). The heart has four chambers. The two top chambers termed `atria` are seperated from the two bottom chambers termed `ventricles` by valves that help control where blood flows during contraction (pumping) of the ventricles.

### Common Conditions
- Heart Failure
    - Heart Failure refers to the inability of the heart to adequatley supply the body with sufficient blood flow (or cardiac output). Common conditions that can cause heart failure are hypertension and myocardial infarction. Common drugs to treat heart failure are coreg (carvediol) or aldaconte (spinornolactone) or lasix (furosemide).

- Arrhythmias
    - Abnormal heart rythms. Can involve the `Atria` and/or the `Ventricle` and can causethe heart to beat slower (bradycardia) or beat faster (tachycardia). Most arrhythmias can decrease cardiac output thus decreaseing perfusion to the rest of the body including the brain. This commonly causes syncope or fainting. Common drugs to help orevent a stroke are plavix (clopidogrel) or coumadin (warafin) or aspririn

- Ischemic Heart Disease/Mycardinal Infarction
    - Ischemic heart disease is commonly a result of atherosclerotic plaques which narrow the lumen of the artieris thus limiting blood flow to important organs and tissues including the heart. Symptoms include chest pain (angina), Atherosclerotic plaques can also break open (rupture) which stimulates a clot to form at the site of rupture

- Hypertension
    - Chronically elevated high blood pressure. Hypertension does not typically cause symptoms yest is a significant factor for cardiovascular disease such as heart failure, ischemic heart disease, myocardinal infarction and stroke. Common drugs to treat hypertension are Zestril/Prinvil (lisinopril) or toprol/lopressor (metroprolol) or Norvasc (Amlodipine) or Cozaar (Losartan) or mixrozide (Hydrochlorothiazide) or tenormin (atenolol) etc.

## Respitory (lungs)
### Anatomy
- The major anatomic components of the respiratory system are the nasal passage (nose), trachea, bronchi (large airway), bronchioles (small airway), and alveoli. Collectivley the bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, and supporting tissue make up the lungs. The Diaphram and intercostal (ribs) muscles are important components of the breathing process

### Function
The respitory anatomy works together to facilitate breathing. Respiration is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lung and the blood. The diaphram contracts and expands the rib cage forcing air into the lung. Nasal passages filter the particals in the air and humidifies the air. Air moves from the bronchi to the smaller bronchioles and ultimatley the alveoli. Muscles surrounding the bronchi and bronchonchiles can constrict or relax to make the airyway narrow or dilated thus controlling of how much air can enter the lung. Exhalation is initiated by relaxation of the diaphram and contraction of the rib cage which forces air out of the lung

### Common conditions
- Asthma 
    - In asthma the bronchi and bronchioles constrict in response to an allergen or even exercise. This bronchoconstriction narrows the airways and reduces air exchange within the lung. Common drugs to treat Asthma are Singulair (montelukast) or pulmicort budesonide, formoterol.
- Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease (COPD)
    - COPD is characterized by progressive destruction of the alveolar sacs thus limiting the ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. An additional characteristic is excessive mucous production within the airways limiting air exchange. The most common cause is smoking (vaping) tabacco. Common drugs to treat COPD are ventolin, proventil, proAir (albuterol) or Advair (Fluticansone/salmeterol)

## Renal
### Anatomy
The renal system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra

### Function
A key function of the kidneys is to filter blood and remove substances (including drugs) from the blood so that they can be eliminated from the body via urine. Another key function of the kidney is to maintain normal water and electrolyte (i.e. sodium, potassium) balance in the body.

### Common Conditions
- Kidney Failure
    - Commonly categorized as acute kidney injury or _AKI_ and chronic kidney disease _CKD_ . AKI is an abrupt decrease in kidney function, CKD may be caused by prolonged AKI but commonly is associated with disease caused by longstanding hypertension and or diabetes

- Urinary Tract Infection _UTI_
    - Commonly involves infection of the bladder (Cystitis) but can progress to involve the kidney (pyelonephritis)

common drugs used to treat conditions related to the renal system or overactive bladder include oxybutynin and antibiotics

## Hepatic (Liver)
### Anatomy and Function
The liver has two major functions: 
- Break down or metabolize toxic substances so that they can be eliminated through the urine
- Make or synthesize many important proteins for the body. `cirrhosis` is a comman manifestation of liver disease caused by viral hepatitis and chronic alcohol abuse.

## Integumant
This system includes the skin, hair, and nails as well as the mammary glands (breasts). This is the bodys first line of defense and acts as a barrier against disease and physical harm

## Skin
The skin or `dermis` is comprised of multiple layers. The outer layer is the `epidermis` which is dead skin cells. Below that is the dermis followd by the hypodermis or `subcutaneous`. Collectivley the skin provides a barrier protecting the underlying tissues from infection and helps maintain hydration

### Common Skin Conditions
- Wart
- Rash _erythema_
- Psoriasis
- Atopic dermatitis
Topical steroids such as _Hydrocortisone_ are commonly used to treat skin conditions

## Musculoskeletal
